                        <p>It was my first visit to the Cox s Bazaar i was so excited and it was not holidays so i have had the best view of the sea. As all the other points were crowded we choose Laboni Point to spend our time. The sea was calm and we stayed more than 3 hours there. The view of that place will make you spell bound. We had enjoyed sunset from the sea and it was the best part of my journey.
                            One incident happened there in the beach, me and my sister forgot the location of our chair were we kept our shoes and left that place bare footed. Me with my sister after one hour or two went to that place again and found our shoes at the same place we left! No one touched them or any other thing never went lost if someone left anything. There were many kids in the beach but no one begs rather they sell something to everyone, This was impressive. I loved that place and want to visit their soon with my friend and family.

                        <p>Bangkok city is one of the places in Thailand that never fails to amused me even after visiting this particular for more than a hundred times for the last 7 years. Whether you choose to ride the BTS or the local buses. Every corner of this city always has an amazing story to tell. I love travelling on the local buses the most if you do not mind the traffic. For a small amount of money you can take the city bus without air-conditioning, take the opportunity to snap a few shoots during the heavy traffic. A good way to experience the city culture. In the night, Bangkok is a city just like New York...never sleeps. The traffic by the night would be much better compared to the day. Take a walk on the busy streets of Silom. You will find stalls selling local merchandises and some local street food. And of course, when you come to Silom you must visit one of their bars. You will definately be fascinated and amazed by one of them. To end the night, why not sit at one the pubs and enjoy some live band music with a mug of reasonably priced beer. Lets take a walk again tomorrow...

                        <p>We went for a trip to see the Taman Negara national park in the jungle. Our driver MJ did a perfect job. While the 3 hours drive into the jungle, we had a nice chat with him with a lot of laughing. MJ was very friendly, amenable & courteous.
                            On the  on the road for so long, we had a nice time inside the car with MJ. It was also his birthday and he had to work, but he wasn't mad or hectic at all. We were chatting nicely and laughed a lot, making the best of the situation. When we arrived in Kuala Lumpur, we saw the Petronas Twin Towers, shining bright and pretty and we adored them. Even though it was his birthday and we were on the road for so long (and his family had to have dinner without him), he offered us to go there in order to take some nice pictures, before heading to the hotel. After that, he even drove us to another very nice building (which I don't know the name of) to take some pictures. After that, he drove us to the Hotel. It was a very pleasant ride & we had a good time with MJ. We can recommend him to everyone who wants to make a tour in or around the city of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
